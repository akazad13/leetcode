# [2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/description))

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as either a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a **local maxima/minima** if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return an array of length `2` containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]` where minDistance is the **minimum distance** between any two distinct critical points and **maxDistance** is
the **maximum distance** between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

 
**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [3,1]
    Output: [-1,-1]
    Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/c097aab5-ff7d-45c3-88a6-6c7fddc10fb3)

    Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
    Output: [1,3]
    Explanation: There are three critical points:
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
    The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
    The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

**Example 3:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/bf06b178-2989-4628-a448-c8c7019d3308)

    Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
    Output: [3,3]
    Explanation: There are two critical points:
    - [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
    - [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
    Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
    Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
    Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.
 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
