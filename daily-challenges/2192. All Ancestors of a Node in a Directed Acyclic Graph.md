# [2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/description)

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where `edges[i]` = **[from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]** denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from **from<sub>i</sub>** to **to<sub>i</sub>** in the graph.

Return a list answer, where `answer[i]` is the list of ancestors of the **i<sup>th</sup>** node, sorted in ascending order.

A node `u` is an ancestor of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.


**Example 1:**


    Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
    Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]
    Explanation:
    The above diagram represents the input graph.
    - Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.
    - Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
    - Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.
    - Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.
    - Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.

**Example 2:**

    Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
    Output: [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]
    Explanation:
    The above diagram represents the input graph.
    - Node 0 does not have any ancestor.
    - Node 1 has one ancestor 0.
    - Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.
    - Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.
    - Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- **0 <= from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1**
- **from<sub>i</sub> != to<sub>i</sub>**
- There are no duplicate edges.
- The graph is directed and acyclic.
