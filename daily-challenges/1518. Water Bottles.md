# [1518. Water Bottles]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/description))

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottle`s and `numExchange`, return the *maximum number of water bottles* you can drink.

**Example 1:**

Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/cadef581-7855-4b32-8982-b7631b462025)

Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`

---

## Solution

Given the two integers `numBottle`s and `numExchange` where `numExchange` denotes the number of empty bottles that can be exchanged to get a full bottle, return the *maximum number of water bottles* you can drink.

### Approach

This is a simple implementational problem where we can count the maximum number of water bottles that we can drink from the available full water bottles and the number of empty bottles that can be exchanged unitl it is not possible to exchange any empty bottle.

#### Algorithm
1. Declare `result = 0` & `result = 0`
2. While `numBottles` is not empty, loop:
    - `result` = `result + numBottles`
    - `curEmptyBottles` = `prevEmptyBottles + numBottles`
    -  `numBottles` = `curEmptyBottles / numExchange`
    - `prevEmptyBottles` = `curEmptyBottles % numExchange`
3. Return `result`

### Explanation with example

    Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
    Output: 13

| `numBottles` | `numExchange` | `result` | `curEmptyBottles` | Updated `numBottles` | `prevEmptyBottles` |
|--------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 9            | 3             | 9        | 9                 | 3                    | 0                  |
| 3            | 3             | 12       | 3                 | 1                    | 0                  |
| 1            | 3             | 13       | 1                 | 0                    | 1                  |

Result is 13.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(log(numBottles)`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int result = 0;
        int prevEmptyBottles = 0;
        while(numBottles) {
            result += numBottles;
            int curEmptyBottles = prevEmptyBottles + numBottles;
            numBottles = curEmptyBottles/numExchange;
            prevEmptyBottles = curEmptyBottles%numExchange;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
