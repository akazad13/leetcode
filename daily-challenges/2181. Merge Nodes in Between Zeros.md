# [2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/description))

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
    Output: [4,11]
    Explanation: 
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
    - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

**Example 2:**

    Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
    Output: [1,3,4]
    Explanation: 
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
    - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- There are no two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
- The beginning and end of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.

## Solution

We can use a two-pointer approach to modify the list. The first pointer, `node`, holds the node needed to be modified and the second pointer, `nextNode`, travers through in between two nodes with value equals to zero and update the summation to `node`.

Initially, both pointers start at the beginning of the list.

The number of nodes in the modified linked list matches the number of blocks between consecutive 0s. After processing each block, we update `node`'s next pointer to `nextNode`, helping maintain the size of the modified list, with both pointers reaching the end simultaneously.

##### Algorithm
1. Initialize `node` and `nextNode` with `head->next` that stores the first node with a non-zero value.
2. Iterate through the list until `node` is not null:
    - Initialize `sum` with `0` to store the sum of the current block.
    - Iterate through the block until `nextNode` encounters a `0`:
        - Add the value of the current node to `sum`.
        - Move `nextNode` to the next node.
    - Modify the node value at `node` to `sum`.
    - Move `nextNode` to the next node that stores the next block's first non-zero value.
    - Set `node->next` to this node.
    - Move `node` to it's next node.
3. Return head->next.


### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* node = head->next;
        ListNode* nextNode = node;

        while(node != NULL) {
            int sum = 0;
            while(nextNode->val != 0) {
                sum += nextNode->val;
                nextNode = nextNode->next;
            }

            node->val = sum;
            nextNode = nextNode->next;
            // update the next pointer to jump to the nextNode
            node->next = nextNode;
            node = node->next;
        }
        return head->next;
    }
};
```
