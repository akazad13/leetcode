# [2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/description)

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where `edges[i]` = **[from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]** denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from **from<sub>i</sub>** to **to<sub>i</sub>** in the graph.

Return a list answer, where `answer[i]` is the list of ancestors of the **i<sup>th</sup>** node, sorted in ascending order.

A node `u` is an ancestor of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.

- There are no duplicate edges.
- The graph is directed and acyclic.

## Solution

### Approach (Topological Sort (BFS) )

The problem centers around the properties of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In a DAG, there are no cycles, and every path progresses clearly from a starting point to an endpoint. This implies that by processing nodes in a specific order, we can systematically determine each node's ancestors.

The key to identifying this optimal processing order lies in topological sorting. In a DAG, topological sorting arranges nodes such that for every directed edge from node `u` to node `v`, `u` precedes `v` in the ordering. This arrangement ensures that when we process a node `v`, all its potential ancestors have already been considered. To achieve this ordering, we will use Kahn's algorithm.

Kahn's algorithm is a method for topologically sorting a directed acyclic graph. It starts by identifying all nodes without incoming edges and placing them in a queue. At each step, it removes a node from the queue, adds it to the sorted list, and eliminates its outgoing edges from the graph. This process may create new nodes without incoming edges, which are then added to the queue. The algorithm continues until the queue is empty, resulting in a valid topological ordering of the graph.

After establishing the topological order, we process each node sequentially. For each node, we iterate through its neighbors, designating both the node itself and its ancestors as ancestors of the neighbor. To efficiently track each node's ancestors, we use a list of sets. Unlike lists, sets maintain unique elements, ensuring each ancestor appears only once in a node's ancestor set.

In the final step, we'll convert these sets of ancestors into lists, as required by the problem statement.

##### Algorithms

1. Initialize a list of lists `graph` to store the edges of the graph and an array `indegree` to store the in-degree of each node.
2. Fill `graph` and the `indegree` array based on the given edges.
3. Initialize a queue `nodesWithZeroIndegree` and add all such nodes to the queue with no in-degree.
4. Initialize a list `topologicalOrder` to store the topological order of nodes and process nodes in the queue. For each node:
    - Reduce the in-degree of its neighbors.
    - Add neighbors with zero in-degree to the queue.
5. Initialize a list `ancestorsList` to store the result and a list of sets `ancestorsSets` to store the ancestors of each node.
6. For each `node` in the `topologicalorder`:
    - Loop over all neighbors `v` of `node`. For each `v`:
        - Add `node` as the immediate parent of `v` to the set `ancestorsSetList[v]`.
        - Add all other ancestors of `node` to the set `ancestorsSetList[v]`.
7. Add the contents of each set to it's corresponding list in `ancestorsList` in ascending order.
8. Return `ancestorsList`, which contains the ancestors of each node in the graph.

### Complexity

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the graph and `m` be the length of the edges array.

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 + m)`

    - Creating and filling the adjacency list and in-degree array requires `O(n+m)` time.
    - Topological sort on the graph also needs `O(n+m)` time.
    - In the worst-case scenario, if the graph forms a chain, the time complexity could be `O(n^2)`. This is because each node in the chain would have a growing number of ancestors. So, the sizes of the ancestor lists would be `0, 1, 2, ..., n−2, n−1`. Forming these lists would take another `O(n^2)` time.

    Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n^2 + m)`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2 + m)`

    - An adjacency list for `graph` which takes `O(n+m)` space.
    - An array of size `n` to keep track of the indegree of each node, taking `O(n)` space.
    - Queue requires maximum `O(n)` space.
    - The topological order list requires `O(n)` space.
    - Maintaining a list of sets to store the ancestors requires `O(n^2)` space in the worst case.

    So, the total space complexity comes out to be `O(n^2+m)`.

        for(auto edge:edges) {
            int from = edge[0];
            int to = edge[1];

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(indegree[i] == 0) {
                nodeWithZeroIndegree.push(i);
            }
        }

        vector<int> topologicalOrder;

        while(!nodeWithZeroIndegree.empty()) {
            int u = nodeWithZeroIndegree.front();
            nodeWithZeroIndegree.pop();
            topologicalOrder.push_back(u);
            for(int v:graph[u]) {
                indegree[v]--;
                if(indegree[v] == 0) {
                    nodeWithZeroIndegree.push(v);
                }
            }
        }

        vector<vector<int>> ancestorsList(n);
        vector<set<int>> ancestorsSets(n);

        for(int node:topologicalOrder) {
            for(int v:graph[node]) {
                ancestorsSets[v].insert(node);
                ancestorsSets[v].insert(ancestorsSets[node].begin(), ancestorsSets[node].end());
            }
        }

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            ancestorsList[i].assign(ancestorsSets[i].begin(), ancestorsSets[i].end());
            sort(ancestorsList[i].begin(), ancestorsList[i].end());
        }

        return ancestorsList;
    }
};
