# [1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/description/)

There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for `n` minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array `customers` of length n where `customers[i]` is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the `ith` minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the `ith` minute, and is `0` otherwise.

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for `minutes` consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

**Example 1:**

    Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], minutes = 3
    Output: 16
    Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
    The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.

**Example 2:**

    Input: customers = [1], grumpy = [0], minutes = 1
    Output: 1
 

**Constraints:**

- `n == customers.length == grumpy.length`
- `1 <= minutes <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= customers[i] <= 1000`
- `grumpy[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution

## Intuition
The problem involves maximizing customer satisfaction in a bookstore where the owner can control their grumpiness for a consecutive number of minutes. The key challenge is to decide when to use this "non-grumpy" period to maximize the number of satisfied customers.

## Approach
1. **Initialize Variables:**

    - initialSatisfaction: Sum of customers during non-grumpy minutes.
    - maxAdditionalSatisfaction : Maximum additional satisfaction we can get using the non-grumpy technique.

2. **Calculate Initial Satisfaction:**

    - Iterate over the customers array and add customers where the owner is not grumpy.

3. **Sliding Window to Find Maximum Additional Satisfaction:**

    - Initialize curWindowSatisfaction to calculate the satisfaction within the first minutes window where the owner would otherwise be grumpy.
    - Use the sliding window technique to move through the customers array and update the curWindowSatisfaction for each position.
    - Track the maximum satisfaction obtained in any window.

4. **Combine Both Results:**

    - The final result is the sum of initialSatisfaction and maxAdditionalSatisfaction .

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity: O(n)**
    - Calculating the initial satisfaction takes O(n).
    - The sliding window to find the maximum additional satisfaction also takes O(n).
- **Space Complexity: O(1)**
    - We use a constant amount of additional space for variables.

## Step by Step Explanation
### Step 1: Calculate Initial Satisfaction
Only consider minutes when `grumpy[i] == 0`.

| Minute | Customers | Grumpy | Satisfied Customers (if not grumpy) |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 0      | 1         | 0      | 1                                   |
| 1      | 0         | 1      | 0                                   |
| 2      | 1         | 0      | 1                                   |
| 3      | 2         | 1      | 0                                   |
| 4      | 1         | 0      | 1                                   |
| 5      | 1         | 1      | 0                                   |
| 6      | 7         | 0      | 7                                   |
| 7      | 5         | 1      | 0                                   |
| Total  |           |        | 10                                  |

Initial satisfaction: `1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 10`

### Step 2: Sliding Window for Additional Satisfaction
Calculate the additional satisfaction using a sliding window of size `minutes = 3`.

| Window Start | Additional Satisfied Customers | Updated Total Satisfaction |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0-2          | 0                         | 10                         |
| 1-3          | 2                         | 12                         |
| 2-4          | 0                         | 12                         |
| 3-5          | 3                         | 13                         |
| 4-6          | 1                         | 13                         |
| 5-7          | 6                         | 16                         |

Maximum additional satisfaction: `6` (in the window from minute 5 to 7)

### Final Result
Total maximum satisfied customers: `Initial Satisfaction + Max Additional Satisfaction = 10 + 6 = 16`

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int minutes) {
        int initialSatisfaction = 0;
        int curWindowSatisfaction = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<customers.size();i++) {
            if(!grumpy[i]) {
                initialSatisfaction += customers[i];
            }
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = minutes;

        for(int i=0;i<right;i++) {
            if(grumpy[i]) {
                curWindowSatisfaction += customers[i];
            }
        }

        int maxAdditionalSatisfaction = curWindowSatisfaction;
        while(right < customers.size()) {
            if(grumpy[right]) {
                curWindowSatisfaction += customers[right];
            }

            if(grumpy[left]) {
                curWindowSatisfaction -= customers[left];
            }
            maxAdditionalSatisfaction = max(maxAdditionalSatisfaction, curWindowSatisfaction);
            right++;
            left++;
        }

        return initialSatisfaction+maxAdditionalSatisfaction;
    }
};
```
