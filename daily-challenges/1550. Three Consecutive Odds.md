# [1550. Three Consecutive Odds]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/description))

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.
 
**Example 1:**

    Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.

**Example 2:**

    Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
    Output: true
    Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

---

## Solution

We can easily solve this problem using two pointers. One pointer will be starting point of a segment and the other will loop through the array and count the number of odd numbers from this starting point. If the count is equal to three, we will return `true`. Otherwise we if we found an even number, then update the left pointer to the next point of right pointer and repeat the process.

#### Algorithm

1. First we check if the size of the array `arr` is less than `3`. If it is, we return `false`.
2. Initialize `count` to `0` and `right` pointer to `0`;
3. Iterate through the array and initialize `left` pointer to `0`:
    - While `right` is less than array length and `right` pointer points to odd number:
        - Increment `count` and `right` pointer
        - If `count` is equal to `3`, return `true`
    - Increament `right` pointer
    - Move `left` pointer to  `right` pointer
    - Reset `count` is equal to `0` and repeat steps.
4. If we do not find three consecutive odd numbers yet, return `false`

### Explanation with example

    Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
    Output: true

| `left` | `right` | `arr[right]` | `count` | `right`(Updated)|
|--------|---------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| 0      | 0       | 1            | 1       | 1               |
| 0      | 1       | 2            | 0       | 2               |
| 2      | 2       | 34           | 0       | 3               |
| 3      | 3       | 3            | 1       | 4               |
| 3      | 4       | 4            | 0       | 5               |
| 5      | 5       | 5            | 1       | 6               |
| 5      | 6       | 7            | 2       | 7               |
| 5      | 7       | 23           | `3`     |                 |

The result is `true`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` as we visit each array element once in worst case.

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool threeConsecutiveOdds(vector<int>& arr) {
        if(arr.size() < 3)
            return false;

         int right = 0;
         int count = 0;

         for(int left=0; left< arr.size(); ) {
            while(right < arr.size() && arr[right]%2 == 1) {
                count++;
                right++;

                if(count == 3) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            right = right + 1;
            left = right;
            count = 0;
         }
         return false;
    }
};
```
