# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description)

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the **i<sup>the<sup>** job, and
 - `worker[j]` is the ability of **j<sup>the<sup>** worker (i.e., the **j<sup>the<sup>** worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

**Example 1:**

    Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
    Output: 100
    Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

**Example 2:**

    Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
    Output: 0
 
**Constraints:**

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 104`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105`

---

## Solution

Given `n` jobs with their difficulties and profits and m workers, we need to use those workers to do jobs so that the profit can be maximized. Any job can be done multiple times by different workers.

### Approach #1: Greedy and Two-Pointers (Sorting)

We can start by sorting the jobs by their difficulty so that the more difficult jobs are on the right. For each job difficulty, we then calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved by completing a job with a difficulty less than or equal to the current difficulty.

Next, we sort the workers by their abilities. For each worker, we select the job with the highest difficulty that is still less than or equal to the worker's ability and add its profit to the total.

Finally, the total profit accumulated will be the result.

### Explanation with example

**Input:** `difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10]`, `profit = [10,20,30,40,50]`, `worker = [4,5,6,7]`
**Output:** `100`

`jobs: [(2, 10), (4, 20), (6, 30), (8, 40), (10, 50)]`
`profit: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
`worker: [4, 5, 6, 7]`

| `i` | `curIdx` | `jobs[curIdx].first` | `worker[i]` | updated `curIdx` | `profit[curIdx -1]` | `maxProfit` |
|-----|----------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 0   | 0        | 2                    | 4           | 2                | 20                  | 20          |
| 1   | 2        | 6                    | 5           | 2                | 20                  | 40          |
| 2   | 2        | 6                    | 6           | 3                | 30                  | 70          |
| 3   | 3        | 8                    | 7           | 3                | 30                  | 100         |

### Complexity

Let nnn be the size of the difficulty and profit arrays, and m be the size of the worker array.

- **Time Complexity:**

    - for sorting jobs array: `O(nlogn)`
    - for sorting workers array: `O(mlogm)`
 
    - Total `O(nlogn + mlogm)`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - Additional `O(n)` space.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        vector<pair<int,int>> jobs;
        for(int i=0;i<difficulty.size();i++) {
            jobs.push_back(make_pair(difficulty[i], profit[i]));
        }
        sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());

        profit[0] = jobs[0].second;

        for(int i=1;i<profit.size();i++) {
            profit[i] = max(jobs[i].second, profit[i-1]);
        }
        sort(worker.begin(), worker.end());

        int maxProfit = 0;
        int curIdx = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<worker.size();i++) {
            while(curIdx < jobs.size() && jobs[curIdx].first <= worker[i]) {
                    curIdx++;
            }
            if(curIdx) {
                maxProfit += profit[curIdx-1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Approach #2: Memorization

Given the constraints on the maximum values of the difficulty and ability arrays, we can create an array of this size to store the maximum profit for every possible ability.

Since we don't need the profit of jobs with a difficulty level higher than what any worker can handle, we can create an array sized to the maximum ability to store these results.

We store the profit in this array using the difficulty of each job as the index. If multiple jobs have the same difficulty, we store the maximum profit among them.

However, if a job with lower difficulty provides higher profit than a job with higher difficulty, we need to ensure that each index reflects the maximum profit achievable up to that difficulty. Thus, we must store the maximum profit values encountered so far in this array while iterating through the abilities.

The maximum total profit is then given by summing the values in this array at the indices corresponding to each worker's ability.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize maxAbility as the maximum ability in the worker array.
2. Initialize an array jobs of size maxAbility.
3. Iterate a variable i from 0 to difficulty.size - 1:
    - If the difficulty at the current index i is less than or equal to the worker's ability:
        - Store the profit at index i at the difficulty[i] index of jobs array. If a value already exists, take the maximum of both values.
4. Iterate through all values in jobs:
    - Store the maximum of current and previous jobs values in the current jobs index.
5. Iterate through all abilities in the worker array:
    - Update maxProfit by jobs[ability] where ability denotes the ability of the current worker.
6. Return maxProfit

### Explanation with example

**Input:** `difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10]`, `profit = [10,20,30,40,50]`, `worker = [4,5,6,7]`
**Output:** `100`

`maxAbility` = `7`
`jobs` = `[0, 0 , 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30]` - after first for loop

`jobs` = `[0, 0 , 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 30]` - after second for loop


| `i` | `worker[i]` | `jobs[worker[i]]` | maxProfit |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0   | 4           | 20                | 20        |
| 1   | 5           | 20                | 40        |
| 2   | 6           | 30                | 70        |
| 3   | 7           | 30                | 100       |

### Complexity

Let `n` be the size of the difficulty and profit arrays, and `m` be the size of the worker array.

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(m + maxAbility)`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(maxAbility)` space.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        int maxAbility = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<worker.size(); i++) {
            maxAbility = max(maxAbility, worker[i]);
        }
        
        vector<int> jobs(maxAbility + 1, 0);

        for(int i=0; i<difficulty.size(); i++) {
            if(difficulty[i] <= maxAbility) {
                jobs[difficulty[i]] = max(jobs[difficulty[i]], profit[i]);
            }
        }

        for(int i=1; i<=maxAbility; i++) {
            jobs[i] = max(jobs[i], jobs[i-1]);
        }

        int maxProfit = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<worker.size();i++) {
            maxProfit += jobs[worker[i]];
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
