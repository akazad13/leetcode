# [2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/description))

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
    Output: [4,11]
    Explanation: 
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
    - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

**Example 2:**

    Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
    Output: [1,3,4]
    Explanation: 
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
    - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
    - The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- There are no two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
- The beginning and end of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.
