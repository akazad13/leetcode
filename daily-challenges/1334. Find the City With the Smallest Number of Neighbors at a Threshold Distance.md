# [1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description)

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i]` = [**from<sub>i<sub>**, **to<sub>i<sub>**, **weight<sub>i<sub>**] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities
**from<sub>i<sub>** and **to<sub>i<sub>**, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the *city with the smallest number of cities* that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities `i` and `j` is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 
**Example 1:**

    Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
    The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
    City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
    City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
    City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
    City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
    Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

**Example 2:**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce7ff326-f354-4b13-8a77-997c8bcbf3d0" width="350">

    Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
    The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
    City 0 -> [City 1] 
    City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
    City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
    City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
    City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
    The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- 0 <= **from<sub>i<sub>** < **to<sub>i<sub>** < n
- 1 <= **weight<sub>i<sub>** , distanceThreshold <= 10^4
- All pairs (**from<sub>i<sub>** , **to<sub>i<sub>**) are distinct.

## Solution

**Brief explanation of the problem and the solution.**

### Approach

**Detailed explanation of the solution.**

### Explanation with example

**explain the approach with example.**

### Complexity

Let `n` refer to the number of cities, where the constraints are `2<=n<=100`, and `m` refers to the number of edges, with `1<=edges.length<= n⋅(n−1)/2`. This means that `m` can be at most `n⋅(n−1)/2`,
representing the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph where every city is connected to every other city with a unique edge.

- **Time Complexity:**

    - The Floyd-Warshall algorithm directly computes the shortest paths between all pairs of cities in `O(n^3)`, regardless of the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity:**

    - The space complexity is dominated by the `distances`, which requires `O(n^2)` space to store the shortest path distances between each pair of cities.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        const int INF = 1e8 + 7;
        
        vector<vector<int>> distances(n, vector<int>(n, INF));

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            distances[i][i] = 0;
        }

        for(const auto& edge:edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int weight = edge[2];

            distances[u][v] = weight;
            distances[v][u] = weight;
        }

        Floyd_Warshall(n, distances);

        return getCityWithFewestReachable(n, distances, distanceThreshold);
    }

private:

    void Floyd_Warshall(int vertex, vector<vector<int>>& distances)
    {
        for(int k=0; k <vertex; k++)
        {
            for(int i=0; i<vertex; i++)
            {
                for(int j=0; j<vertex; j++)
                {
                    if(distances[i][j]>distances[i][k]+distances[k][j])
                    {
                        distances[i][j] = distances[i][k]+distances[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int getCityWithFewestReachable(int n, vector<vector<int>>& distances, int distanceThreshold) {
        int cityWithMinReachableCount = -1;
        int curMinReachableCityCount = n;

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            int reachableCityCount = 0;
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
                if(i==j)
                    continue;
                
                if(distances[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                    reachableCityCount++;
                }
            }

            if(reachableCityCount <=curMinReachableCityCount) {
                curMinReachableCityCount = reachableCityCount;
                cityWithMinReachableCount = i;
            }
        }

        return cityWithMinReachableCount;
    }
};
