# [1550. Three Consecutive Odds]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/description))

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.
 
**Example 1:**

    Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.

**Example 2:**

    Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
    Output: true
    Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
