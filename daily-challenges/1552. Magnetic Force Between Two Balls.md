# [1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/description)

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the **i<sup>th</sup>** basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return the required force.

 

**Example 1:**

![alt text](q3v1.jpg)

    Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4, and 7 will make 
    the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic 
    force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

**Example 2:**

    Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
    Output: 999999999
    Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
 
**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
- All integers in `position` are distinct.
- `2 <= m <= position.length`

## Solution

The problem is to distribute `m` balls into `n` baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized. The magnetic force between two balls at positions `x` and `y` is defined as `|x - y|`.

So, given a minimum distance `dist` between two balls, if it is possible to distribute m balls into the basket, we can distribute them for any distance < `dist` as well. As a result, we can discard the lower values from the result. Binary search is a suitable technique for this optimization problem where we can easily partition the possible results.

### Approach
1. **Sorting:**

    - First, we sort the array of basket positions. This helps us to efficiently check the possible placement of balls in increasing order of positions.

2. **Binary Search:**

    - We perform a binary search on the minimum distance (`dist`) values between two balls.
    - The lower bound (lo) of our search range is 1 (the smallest possible distance).
    - The upper bound (hi) is (position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m-1), which is the maximum possible minimum distance when placing m balls in n baskets.

3. **Placement Check:**

    - For each mid value in our binary search, we check if it is possible to place m balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least mid.
    - We start by placing the first ball in the first basket and then attempt to place each subsequent ball in the next available basket that is at least mid-distance away from the last placed ball.
    - If we successfully place all m balls, it means mid is a feasible distance, and we try for a larger distance. If not, we try a smaller distance.

### Explanation with example

1. **Initial Setup and Sorting:**

    - Sort the position array to ensure the positions are in ascending order for easier placement checking.
    - Set `lo` to `1` and `hi` to the maximum possible minimum distance `(position[n-1] - position[0]) / (m - 1)`

2. **Binary Search:**

    - Perform a binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance. Iterate until lo is less than or equal to hi. Calculate mid and check placement feasibility.
    - For each mid value, check if it is possible to place m balls with at least mid distance apart. The variable `ans` holds the maximum possible minimum distance after the search completes.

3. **canDistribute function for placement check:**

    - Traverse the position array to place balls.
    - Use a counter to count the number of balls placed and update the position of the last placed ball.
    - If the required number of balls are placed, return true, otherwise return false.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**

    - Sorting the position array takes `O(nlogn)`.
    - Binary search involves `O(log((position[n-1] - position[0]) / m)` iterations. Assuming `k = position[n-1] - position[0]`
    - Each iteration of the binary search involves a linear scan through the baskets to check the feasibility, which takes `O(n)`.
    - Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(nlogn + nlog(k/m))`.

- **Space Complexity:**

    - The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are only using a few extra variables for binary search and placement check. `O(logn)` space for quicksort.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        
        int lo = 1;
        int hi = (position.back() - position[0]) / (m-1);
        int ans = 0;

        while(lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo+hi) >> 1;

            if(canDistribute(position, m, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                lo = mid+1;
            } else {
                hi = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    bool canDistribute(vector<int>& position, int m, int magneticForce) {
        int nextPosition = position[0] + magneticForce;
        int taken = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<position.size(); i++) {
            if(nextPosition <= position[i]) {
                taken++;
                nextPosition = position[i] + magneticForce;
            }
            if(taken == m) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
