Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a *binary search tree* is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
    Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = [0,null,1]
    Output: [1,null,1]
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.

## Solution

To convert a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a Greater Tree, the main idea is to traverse the tree in a reverse in-order fashion (right -> node -> left) and keep track of the accumulated sum of node values. This ensures that you are adding all the greater values to each node as you visit them.

### Approach

1. Initialize a variable `nodeSum` to keep track of the cumulative sum.
2. Define a helper function `traverseBst` that performs the reverse in-order traversal and updates the node values.
3. Traverse the tree starting from the root.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` where n is the total number of the nodes

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` for using stack while recurive call

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* bstToGst(TreeNode* root) {
        int nodeSum = 0;
        traverseBst(root, nodeSum);
        return root;
    }

    void traverseBst(TreeNode* node, int& nodeSum) {
        if(node == NULL) {
            return;
        }

        traverseBst(node->right, nodeSum);

        nodeSum += node->val;
        node->val = nodeSum;

        traverseBst(node->left, nodeSum);
        return;
    }
};
```
