# [2751. Robot Collisions](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-collisions/description)

There are `n` **1-indexed** robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either `'L'` for **left** or `'R'` for **right**). All integers in positions are unique.

All robots start moving on the line **simultaneously** at the **same speed** in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**.

If two robots collide, the robot with **lower health** is **removed** from the line, and the health of the other robot **decreases by one**. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. 
If both robots have the **same** health, they are both removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order** that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), 
final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return *an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.*

**Note:** The positions may be unsorted.

**Example 1:**

  Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
  Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
  Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots 
  in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f458dce9-e0c6-468f-a562-dba02b4b0ccf)

  Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
  Output: [14]
  Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health,
  they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed,
  and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

**Example 3:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc79fd4-beaa-4903-96f9-6e1420ad1f6d)

  Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
  Output: []
  Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will 
  collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 10^9`
- `directions[i] == 'L'` or `directions[i] == 'R'`
- All values in `positions` are distinct

## Solution

**Brief explanation of the problem and the solution.**

### Approach

**Detailed explanation of the solution.**

### Explanation with example

**explain the approach with example.**

### Complexity

Let `n` be the number of robots.

- **Time Complexity:** `O(nlogn)`

    -  Initializing the indices array takes `O(n)` time.
    - Sorting the robots based on their positions takes `O(nlogn)` time.
    - The for loop that processes each robot runs in `O(n)` time since each robot is processed once.

  Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it `O(nlogn)`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

    - The sort() function typically uses a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of `O(logn)`.
    - Apart from this, we use an additional space of `O(n)` for the indices array.
    - The stack in the worst case holds `O(n)` elements.
  Therefore, the total space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> survivedRobotsHealths(vector<int>& positions, vector<int>& healths, string directions) {
        int n = positions.size();
        vector<int> indicies(n);

        // Used to track the robot position by number ( index + 1)
        for(int index=0; index<n; index++) {
            indicies[index] = index;
        }

        // for positions = [3,5,2,6],  indicies = [2, 0, 1, 3]
        sort(indicies.begin(), indicies.end(), [&](int left, int right) {
            return positions[left] < positions[right];
        });

        stack<int> stk;

        for(int index:indicies) {
            if(directions[index] == 'R') {
                stk.push(index);
            } else {
                while(!stk.empty() && healths[index] > 0) {
                    auto top = stk.top();
                    stk.pop();

                    if(healths[index] > healths[top]) {
                        healths[index] = healths[index]-1;
                        healths[top] = 0;
                    } else if(healths[index] < healths[top]) {
                        stk.push(top);
                        healths[top] = healths[top]-1;
                        healths[index] = 0;
                    } else {
                        healths[top] = 0;
                        healths[index] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        vector<int> remainingRobotsHealth;

        for(auto health:healths) {
            if(health != 0) {
                remainingRobotsHealth.push_back(health);
            }
        }
        return remainingRobotsHealth;
    }
};
```
