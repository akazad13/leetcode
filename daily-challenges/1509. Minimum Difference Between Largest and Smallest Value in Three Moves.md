# [1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/description))

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to any value.

Return the *minimum difference* between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after performing at most three moves.

 
**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
    In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
    In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
    In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
    After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
    In the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].
    In the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].
    In the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].
    After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 1.
    It can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [3,100,20]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
    In the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,20].
    In the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [3,7,7].
    In the third move, change 3 to 7. nums becomes [7,7,7].
    After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

        if(nums.size() < 5) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Partially sort the first four elements
        partial_sort(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + 4, nums.end());
        // Find the 4th largest element
        nth_element(nums.begin() + 4, nums.begin() + (nums.size() - 4),
                    nums.end());
        // Sort the last four elements
        sort(nums.begin() + (nums.size() - 4), nums.end());

        int minDiff = INT_MAX;

        for(int left=0, right = nums.size() - 4; left<4; left++, right++) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[right] - nums[left]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};
