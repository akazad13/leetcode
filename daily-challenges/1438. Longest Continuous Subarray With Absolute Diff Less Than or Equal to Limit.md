# [1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/description)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the **longest non-empty subarray** such that the **absolute difference** between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
    Output: 2 
    Explanation: All subarrays are: 
    [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
    [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
    [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
    [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
    [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
    [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
    [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
    [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
    Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
    Output: 4 
    Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
    Example 3:

    Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
    Output: 3
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= limit <= 10^9`

## Solution

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, we need to find the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

### Approach :

To solve this problem, we will use two deques.

1. **Maintaining Minimum Values:** The first deque maintains numbers in increasing order. This ensures that the smallest number in the current window is always at the front. If a new number is smaller than those at the end of this deque, it will replace them.

2. **Maintaining Maximum Values:** The second deque maintains numbers in decreasing order. This ensures that the largest number in the current window is always at the front. If a new number is larger than those at the end of this deque, we remove those elements.

These deques hold all potential minimum and maximum values for the current and future windows.

When expanding the window to include a new element, we add it to both deques while preserving their order. If the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values at the front of the deques exceeds the limit, we shrink the window by moving the left pointer. By removing elements from the front of either deque, we can maintain the correct minimum and maximum values in constant time. This enables efficient checks to ensure the window stays within the specified limit.

### Algorithm

1. Initialization:
    - Initialize two deques, `incQ` and `decQ`.
    - Initialize `left` to `0` to represent the start of the sliding window.
    - Initialize `longestNonEmptySubArray` to `0` to store the length of the longest valid subarray.
    - `n = size of the nums array`

2. Iterate through the array nums from left to right using a variable right:
    - For each element `nums[right]`:
        - Maintain the `incQ` in increasing order:
            - While incQ is not empty and the last element in incQ is greater than `nums[right]`:
                - Remove the last element from `incQ`.
            - Add `nums[right]` to the back of `incQ`.
        - Maintain the decQ in decreasing order:
            - While `decQ` is not empty and the last element in `decQ` is less than `nums[right]`:
                - Remove the last element from `decQ`.
            - Add `nums[right]` to the back of `decQ`.

        - Check if the current window exceeds the limit:
            - While the difference between the first elements of `decQ` and `incQ` is greater than limit:
                - If the first element of `decQ` is equal to `nums[left]`:
                    - Remove the first element from `decQ`.
                - If the first element of `incQ` is equal to `nums[left]`:
                    - Remove the first element from `incQ`.
                - Increment `left` by `1`.
        - Update `longestNonEmptySubArray`:
            - Set `longestNonEmptySubArray` to the maximum of max `longestNonEmptySubArray` Length and `(right - left + 1)`.
3. Return `longestNonEmptySubArray` which stores the length of the longest valid subarray.

### Explanation with example

Let's walk through the execution of the program step-by-step with a visual explanation for the input `nums = [8, 2, 4, 7]` and `limit = 4`.

1. Initialization:

    - `incQ` (deque for maintaining increasing order): `[]`
    - `decQ` (deque for maintaining decreasing order): `[]`
    - left pointer: `0`
    - `longestNonEmptySubArray`: `0`
    - `n (length of nums): 4`

2. Iteration 1 (`right = 0`):

    - Current number: `8`
    - Add `8` to both `incQ` and `decQ`:
        - `incQ`: `[8]`
        - `decQ`: `[8]`
    - Condition `decQ`[0] - `incQ`[0] > `limit` is `false` `(8 - 8 = 0 <= 4)`
    - Update `longestNonEmptySubArray` to `max(0, 0 - 0 + 1) = 1`

3. Iteration 2 (`right = 1`):

    - Current number: `2`
    - Remove elements from `incQ` until the back element is less than or equal to `2`:
        - `incQ`: `[]` (`8` is removed)
    - Add `2` to `incQ`:
        - `incQ`: [2]
    - Add 2 to `decQ`:
        - `decQ`: `[8, 2]`
    - Condition `decQ`[0] - `incQ`[0] > `limit` is `true` `(8 - 2 = 6 > 4)`
        - Remove `8` from `decQ` because it is equal to `nums[left]` (`left` is `0`):
            - `decQ`: `[2]`
        - Move `left` pointer to `1`:
            - `left: 1`
    - Update `longestNonEmptySubArray` to `max(1, 1 - 1 + 1) = 1`

4. Iteration 3 (`right = 2`):

    - Current number: `4`
    - Add `4` to `incQ`:
        - `incQ`: `[2, 4]`
    - Remove elements from `decQ` until the back element is greater than or equal to `4`:
        - `decQ`: `[]` (2 is removed)
    - Add `4` to `decQ`:
        - `decQ`: [4]
    - Condition `decQ`[0] - `incQ`[0] > `limit` is `false` `(4 - 2 = 2 <= 4)`
    - Update `longestNonEmptySubArray` to `max(1, 2 - 1 + 1) = 2`

5. Iteration 4 (`right = 3`):

    - Current number: `7`
    - Add `7` to `incQ`:
        - `incQ`: `[2, 4, 7]`
    - Remove elements from `decQ` until the back element is greater than or equal to `7`:
        - `decQ`: `[]` (4 is removed)
    - Add 7 to `decQ`:
        - `decQ`: [7]
    - Condition `decQ`[0] - `incQ`[0] > `limit` is `true` `(7 - 2 = 5 > 4)`
        - Remove `2` from `incQ` because it is equal to `nums[left]` (left is 1):
            - `incQ`: `[4, 7]`
        - Move `left` pointer to `2`:
            - left: 2
    - Condition `decQ`[0] - `incQ`[0] > `limit` is `false` `(7 - 4 = 3 <= 4)`
    - Update `longestNonEmptySubArray` to `max(2, 3 - 2 + 1) = 2`

**Summary:**
After iterating through the entire array, the `longestNonEmptySubArray` is `2`, which corresponds to the subarray `[2, 4]` or `[4, 7]`


### Complexity

Let `n` be the length of the array `nums`.

- **Time Complexity:**

    - Initializing the two deques, `incQ` and `decQ`, takes `O(1)` time.

    - Iterating through the array `nums` from `left` to `right` involves a single loop that runs `n` times.

    - Maintaining `incQ` and `decQ` involves adding and removing elements. Each element can be added and removed from the deques at most once, resulting in `O(1)` time per operation. Over the entire array, this results in `O(n)` time for both deques combined.

    - Checking the condition and potentially shrinking the window involves deque operations, which each take `O(1)` time. Over the entire array, this takes `O(n)` time.

    - Updating the maxLength variable involves a simple comparison and assignment, each taking `O(1)` time per iteration. Over the entire array, this takes `O(n)` time.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**

    - The two deques, `incQ` and `decQ`, store elements of the array. In the worst case, each deque could store all `n` elements of the array.

    - The additional variables `left`, `right`, and `longestNonEmptySubArray` use constant space.

    - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)` due to the deques storing up to `n` elements in the worst case.


**Bonus Approaches:** 
1. Using two heap (min and max priority queues). complexity: `O(nlogn)`.
2. Using multiset.  complexity: `O(nlogn)`.
### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        deque<int> incQ, decQ;
        int left = 0;
        int longestNonEmptySubArray = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        for(int right= 0; right<n; right++) {
            while(!incQ.empty() && incQ.back() > nums[right]) {
                incQ.pop_back();
            }

            incQ.push_back(nums[right]);

            while(!decQ.empty() && decQ.back() < nums[right]) {
                decQ.pop_back();
            }

            decQ.push_back(nums[right]);

            while(decQ.front() - incQ.front() > limit) {
                if(decQ.front() == nums[left]) {
                    decQ.pop_front();
                }

                if(incQ.front() == nums[left]) {
                    incQ.pop_front();
                }

                left++;
            }
            longestNonEmptySubArray = max(longestNonEmptySubArray, right - left + 1);
        }
        return longestNonEmptySubArray;
    }
};
```
