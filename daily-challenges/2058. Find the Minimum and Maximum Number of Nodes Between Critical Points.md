# [2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/description)

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as either a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a **local maxima/minima** if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return an array of length `2` containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]` where minDistance is the **minimum distance** between any two distinct critical points and **maxDistance** is
the **maximum distance** between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

 
**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [3,1]
    Output: [-1,-1]
    Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/c097aab5-ff7d-45c3-88a6-6c7fddc10fb3)

    Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
    Output: [1,3]
    Explanation: There are three critical points:
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
    - [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
    The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
    The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

**Example 3:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/bf06b178-2989-4628-a448-c8c7019d3308)

    Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
    Output: [3,3]
    Explanation: There are two critical points:
    - [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
    - [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
    Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
    Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
    Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.
 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution

Given a linked list head, we need to return an array of length 2 containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]` where `minDistance` is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and `maxDistance` is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Approach

For calculating `maxDistance`, we need to find the first and last critical point in the linked list and get the distance between them.

For calculating `minDistance`, we need to find the minimum distance between any two adjacent critical points.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize a `result` vector with `[-1,-1]`.
2. if there is only 3 node in the linked list, it is not possible to get the critical point, hence, return `result`.
3. Initialize `firstCriticalPoint` and `lastFoundCriticalPoint` with `-1`, `cur` with `1`.
4. While `head->next->next` is not null:
    - `left`: `head->val`
    - `mid`: `head->next->val`
    - `right`: `head->next->next->val`

    - If `mid` is a critical point
        - If critical point is found first time
            - `firstCriticalPoint ` = `cur`
        - else, `result[1]` = `cur - firstCriticalPoint` // calculate maximum distance

        - If critical point is found first time
            - `lastFoundCriticalPoint` = `cur`
        - else
            - if `result[0]` = `-1`
                - `result[0]` = `cur - lastFoundCriticalPoint`
            - else
                - `result[0]` = `min(result[0], cur - lastFoundCriticalPoint)`
            - `lastFoundCriticalPoint` = `cur`
    - Increament `cur` by 1.
    - Move `head` to next node.
5. Return `result`


### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(size_of_linked_list)`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

public:
    vector<int> nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> result(2,-1);
        if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL || head->next->next == NULL)
        {
            return result;
        }

        int firstCriticalPoint = -1;
        int lastFoundCriticalPoint = -1;

        int cur = 1;

        while(head->next->next != NULL) {
            int left = head->val; 
            int mid = head->next->val;
            int right = head->next->next->val; 

            if((left < mid && mid > right) || (left > mid && mid < right)) {
                if(firstCriticalPoint == -1) {
                    firstCriticalPoint = cur;
                } else {
                    result[1] = cur - firstCriticalPoint;
                }

                if(lastFoundCriticalPoint == -1) {
                    lastFoundCriticalPoint = cur;
                } else {
                    if(result[0] == -1) {
                        result[0] = cur - lastFoundCriticalPoint;
                    } else {
                        result[0] = min(result[0], cur - lastFoundCriticalPoint);
                    }
                    lastFoundCriticalPoint = cur;
                }
            }
            cur++;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
