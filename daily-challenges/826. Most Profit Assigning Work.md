# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description)

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the **i<sup>the<sup>** job, and
 - `worker[j]` is the ability of **j<sup>the<sup>** worker (i.e., the **j<sup>the<sup>** worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

**Example 1:**

    Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
    Output: 100
    Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.

**Example 2:**

    Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
    Output: 0
 
**Constraints:**

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 104`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105`

---

## Solution

Given `n` jobs with their difficulties and profits and m workers, we need to use those workers to do jobs so that the profit can be maximized. Any job can be done multiple times by different workers.

### Approach

We can start by sorting the jobs by their difficulty so that the more difficult jobs are on the right. For each job difficulty, we then calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved by completing a job with a difficulty less than or equal to the current difficulty.

Next, we sort the workers by their abilities. For each worker, we select the job with the highest difficulty that is still less than or equal to the worker's ability and add its profit to the total.

Finally, the total profit accumulated will be the result.

### Explanation with example

**Input:** `difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10]`, `profit = [10,20,30,40,50]`, `worker = [4,5,6,7]`
**Output:** `100`

jobs: [(2, 10), (4, 20), (6, 30), (8, 40), (10, 50)]
profit: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
worker: [4, 5, 6, 7]

| `i` | `curIdx` | `jobs[curIdx].first` | `worker[i]` | updated `curIdx` | `profit[curIdx -1]` | `profit` |
|-----|----------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|----------|
| 0   | 0        | 2                    | 4           | 2                | 20                  | 20       |
| 1   | 2        | 6                    | 5           | 2                | 20                  | 40       |
| 2   | 2        | 6                    | 6           | 3                | 30                  | 70       |
| 3   | 3        | 8                    | 7           | 3                | 30                  | 100      |

### Complexity

Let nnn be the size of the difficulty and profit arrays, and m be the size of the worker array.

- **Time Complexity:**

    - for sorting jobs array: O(nlogn)
    - for sorting workers array: O(mlogm)
 
    - Total O(nlogn) + O(mlogm)

- **Space Complexity:**

    - Additional O(n) space.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        vector<pair<int,int>> jobs;
        for(int i=0;i<difficulty.size();i++) {
            jobs.push_back(make_pair(difficulty[i], profit[i]));
        }
        sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());

        profit[0] = jobs[0].second;

        for(int i=1;i<profit.size();i++) {
            profit[i] = max(jobs[i].second, profit[i-1]);
        }
        sort(worker.begin(), worker.end());

        int maxProfit = 0;
        int curIdx = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<worker.size();i++) {
            while(curIdx < jobs.size() && jobs[curIdx].first <= worker[i]) {
                    curIdx++;
            }
            if(curIdx) {
                maxProfit += profit[curIdx-1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
