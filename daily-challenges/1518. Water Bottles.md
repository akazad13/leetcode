# [1518. Water Bottles]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/description))

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottle`s and `numExchange`, return the *maximum number of water bottles* you can drink.

**Example 1:**

Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/cadef581-7855-4b32-8982-b7631b462025)

Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`
