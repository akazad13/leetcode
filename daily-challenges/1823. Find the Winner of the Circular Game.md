# [1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description)

There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in clockwise order. 
More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the **(i+1)<sup>th</sup> friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the **n<sup>th</sup>** friend brings you to the **1<sup>st</sup>** friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Start at the **1<sup>st</sup>** friend.
2. Count the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
3. The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
4. If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to `step 2` starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
5. Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return the winner of the game.

**Example 1:**

    Input: n = 5, k = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
    1) Start at friend 1.
    2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
    3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
    4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
    5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
    6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
    7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
    8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
    9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.

**Example 2:**

    Input: n = 6, k = 5
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.
 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= n <= 500`

## Solution

Given `n` friends sitting in a circle and a counting number `k`. In each steps, we count next `k` friends in the clockwise direction and the last friend counted leaves the circle. We need to find the last friend in the circle. 

### Approach #1 (Using deque)

We can use a deque to represent the circle. In each step, we will move `k-1` number of friends from front of the deque to back. Then pop the **k<sup>th</sup>** friend. When there is only one friend remaining in the deque, this will be the winner. 

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n*k)` as in each step, the is a loop of `k` times.

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` , maximum size of the deque.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        deque<int> deq;
        for(int i=1; i<=n;i++) {
            deq.push_back(i);
        }

        while(deq.size() != 1) {
            for(int i=1; i<k; i++) {
                int frontNum = deq.front();
                deq.pop_front();
                deq.push_back(frontNum);
            }
            deq.pop_front();
        }

        return deq.front();
    }
};
```

### Approach #2 (Using recursion)

The game involves repeatedly eliminating the k-th friend from a circle, reducing the circle's size with each turn. This suggests that we can break the problem into smaller, similar subproblems.

Let’s consider a smaller instance where `n=4` and `k=2`, tracking both the number and index of each friend in the circle.

Initially, friend `0` is at the beginning of the circle, with each friend's number corresponding to their index (using zero-based indexing).


In the first round, we start counting from friend `0` and eliminate the k-th friend. With `k=2`, we eliminate friend `1` at `index 1`, leaving three friends in the circle.


For the second round, we start counting from the friend immediately after friend `1` (friend 2). The updated indices are now:


From this process, two key insights emerge:

1. The problem, initially dealing with a circle of n friends, now reduces to a subproblem with n-1 friends.

2. In the new subproblem, friend indices shift by -k. For example, friend 3 moves from index 3 to index 1 in the new circle.

These observations suggest a recurrence relation for a recursive solution. Let's define `𝑓(𝑛,𝑘)` as a function that returns the index of the winning friend in a game with `n` friends and a step size of `k`. In our example above, `𝑓(4,2)` would yield the final answer.

We observed that after the first turn, the problem reduces to a smaller subproblem of `𝑓(𝑛−1,𝑘)`. Considering the indexing shift discussed, we can establish the following relationship between `𝑓(𝑛,𝑘)` and `𝑓(𝑛−1,𝑘)`:

`𝑓(𝑛,𝑘) = (𝑓(𝑛−1,𝑘) + 𝑘) mod 𝑛`

We add `k` to `𝑓(𝑛−1,𝑘)` to convert back to the original indexing of the circle of size `n`. As seen, the new indexing on a circle of size `n-1` shifts the original indexing by `-k`. We then take the modulo of this value by the size of the circle to handle cases where the offset wraps around to the start of the circle.

The base case is `𝑓(1,𝑘)= 0`, as the last remaining friend will always be at index `0`.

##### Algorithm
1. Define a `findWinnerHelper(int n, int k)` function where:
2. If the base case is reached (`n == 1`), return `0`.
3. Otherwise, return the recurrence relation expression: (`findWinnerHelper(n−1,k)+k) mod n`.
4. Return the value of the last friend remaining.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` as the function makes `n` recursive calls, each performing `O(1)` operations
- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` , maximum depth of the recursion stack.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        return findWinnerHelper(n, k) + 1;
    }

private:
    int findWinnerHelper(int n, int k) {
        if(n == 1)
            return 0;
        return (findWinnerHelper(n-1, k) + k) % n;
    }
};
```

### Approach #3 (Iterative)

We can further utilize the recurrsive relation we identified earlier, but optimize it by eliminating the extra space overhead from the recursive calls. To achieve this, we start by solving the base case where `n = 1` and then iteratively compute the position of the winner, building up to the solution for `n = N`. This iterative approach efficiently computes the solution without requiring additional space.

##### Algorithm
1. Define a `ans` with `0`
2. iterate through values of `n` from `2` to `N`:
    - compute the answer for current `n` using recurrence relation: `ans = (ans + k) % n`
3. Return `ans + 1`

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int ans = 0;

        for(int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            ans = (ans + k) % i;
        }
        return ans + 1;
    }
};
```
