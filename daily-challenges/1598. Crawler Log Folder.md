# [1598. Crawler Log Folder]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description))

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

The operations are described below:

- `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).
- `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
- `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the **i<sup>th</sup>** step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.


**Example 1:**

    Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.
    
    
**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/akazad13/leetcode/assets/16265339/1522c314-a664-4ef4-9180-b59a4b2de104)

    Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
    Output: 3


**Example 3:**

    Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
    Output: 0
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^3`
- `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
- `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
- `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
- Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.

## Solution

You are given a list of command/logs of navigating through folders. We need to find the **minimum number of operations** needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.


### Approach

There are three types of operations in the logs:
1. `"../"` move to parent folder of current folder
2. `"./"` stay on the same folder
3. And `"x/"` move down to a `x` sub folder.

As the second command does not add any value (there is no location change), we can ignore this one.

Third command move down to a sub folder and hence we need additional operations to go back to the `Main`. First command move upwards and hence reduce the operation needed to go back to the `Main`.

#### Algorithm

1. Declare `operationNeeded` = 0;
2. for each `log` in the `logs`:
    - if `log` is equal to `"../"`
        - if `operationNeeded` is greater than 0  (not on the `Main` folder)
            - Reduce required `operationNeeded` by one.
        - else do nothing
    - else if `log` is not equal to `"./"` (i,e. `log` equal to `"x/"`)
        - Increase required `operationNeeded` by one.
3. Return `operationNeeded`

### Explanation with example

        Input: logs = ["d1/","d1/","../","d21/","./"]
        Output: 2

| log     | `operationNeeded` |
|---------|-------------------|
| `"d1/"` |  1                |
| `"d1/"` |  2                |
| `"../"` |  1                |
| `"d21/"`|  2                |
| `"./"`  |  2                |    

**minimum number of operations** needed = `2`.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**

    - `O(n)` where `n` = size of the `logs`

- **Space Complexity:**

    - `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
        int operationNeeded = 0;

        for(string log:logs) {
            if(log == "../") {
                if(operationNeeded > 0) {
                    operationNeeded--;
                }
            } else if(log != "./") {
                operationNeeded++;
            }
        }
        return operationNeeded;
    }
};
```
